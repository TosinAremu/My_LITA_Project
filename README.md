### Project Title: Data Analysis Training Project

### Project Objective: 
---
The primary objective of this project is to apply the knowledge and skills gained during the Data Analysis training. The focus will be on understanding, processing, and analyzing datasets to draw meaningful insigts. By the end of the project, I aim to develop proficiency in using data analysis tools, interpreting data and presenting findings effectively.

### Data Sources
---
The dataset for analysis will be selected from open-source platforms provided as part of the course. I will ensure that the data is relevant to the problem statement and is well suited for analysis.

### Tools Used:
---
Throughout the training, I will be using the following tools and software.

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. For Data Cleaning
    2. For Analysis and
    3. Data Visualisation
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
---
In the initial phase of the training, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formating
4. Data Valuation

### Exploratory Data Analysis
---
EDA involved the analyzing of datasets to summarize their main characteristics such as;
 - Understanding the Patterns
 - Trends
 - And relationship through Statistical Methods and Visualisation.

### Data Analysis
---
This is where we include some basic lines of code or queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis training.

```SQL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'FEMI'
```
