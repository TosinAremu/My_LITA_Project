### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in the essential techniques of data analysis. Through the training, I will learn how to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret data to support data-driven decision-making. The project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis of a dataset that I will choose, followed by actionable insights presented in the form of a report and data visualizations.

### Key Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this project, I expect to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of data analysis and its applications.
- Develop proficiency in using tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL Server and Power BI.
- Perform data cleaning, including handling missing data and outliners.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns and correlation.
- Visualize data effectively using charts, graphs and dashboards.
- Interpret and present findings to guide decision making.

### Project Phases
Phase 1: Introduction to Data Analysis (Week 1)
- Familiarization with basic data analysis concepts and their importance in various industries.
- Introduction to excel functions, data validation, use of shotcut in excel and aggregate with conditions.
- Learning about different data sources (Structures, unstructures, internal & external).

Phase 2: Excel Functions (Week 2)
- Understanding formulas and functions and how they are used to perform calculations or manipulate data in Excel.
- Use of data cleaning.
- Introduction to pivot table.

Phase 3: Pivot Table (Week 3)
- Introduction to reporting in pivot table.
- Organizing large amount of data with the use of pivot table.
- creating concise, attractive and annotated report for online or printed use.
- Querying large amount of data in a friendly user way.
- Subtotalling and aggregating numeric data, summarizing data by categories and subcategories and creating custom calculations and formula.
- Transforming summarized data into different types of chart (Pie, Area, Line, Bar chart etc).
- Identifying patterns and trends.
- Make comparison and analysze subset of data.

Phase 4: SQL (Structured Query Language) (Week 4)
- Introduction to SQL
- 
 
### Data Sources
The dataset for analysis will be selected from open-source platforms provided as part of the course. I will ensure that the data is relevant to the problem statement and is well suited for analysis.

### Tools Used:
Throughout the training, I will be using the following tools and software.

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. For Data Cleaning
    2. For Analysis and
    3. Data Visualisation
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Power BI for visualisation.
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of the training, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formating
4. Data Valuation

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the analyzing of datasets to summarize their main characteristics such as;
 - Understanding the Patterns
 - Trends
 - And relationship through Statistical Methods and Visualisation.

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of functions,code, queries or even some of the DAX expressions used during the analysis training.
Functions like;
- SUMIF
- AVERAGE
- FIND FUNCTION
- VLOOKUP
- TEXT FUNCTION etc.

Queries like;
```SQL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'FEMI'
```
### Data Visualisation
This is presenting our results using charts, graphs and other visualisation tools.

### Learning Outcome
By the completion of this training, I expect to:
- Develop a strong understanding of data manipulation and analysis techniques
- Improve my ability to interprete and communicate data-driven insights.
- Gain hands on experience with industry standard data analysis tools.
- Build a foundational skill set that will be useful for the real world data analysis tasks.
