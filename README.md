### Project Objective
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in the essential techniques of data analysis. Through the training, I will learn how to clean, analyze, visualize, and interpret data to support data-driven decision-making. The project will culminate in a comprehensive analysis of a dataset that I will choose, followed by actionable insights presented in the form of a report and data visualizations.

### Key Learning Outcomes
Upon successful completion of this project, I expect to:
- Understand the fundamental principles of data analysis and its applications.
- Develop proficiency in using tools such as Microsoft Excel, SQL Server and Power BI.
- Perform data cleaning, including handling missing data and outliners.
- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover trends, patterns and correlation.
- Visualize data effectively using charts, graphs and dashboards.
- Interpret and present findings to guide decision making.

### Data Sources
The dataset for analysis will be selected from open-source platforms provided as part of the course. I will ensure that the data is relevant to the problem statement and is well suited for analysis.

### Tools Used:
Throughout the training, I will be using the following tools and software.

- Microsoft Excel [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
    1. For Data Cleaning
    2. For Analysis and
    3. Data Visualisation
- SQL - Structured Query Language for Querying of Data
- Power BI for visualisation.
- Github for Portfolio Building

### Data Cleaning and Preparations
In the initial phase of the training, we perform the following action;
1. Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing variables
3. Data Cleaning and Formating
4. Data Valuation

### Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved the analyzing of datasets to summarize their main characteristics such as;
 - Understanding the Patterns
 - Trends
 - And relationship through Statistical Methods and Visualisation.

### Data Analysis
This is where we include some basic lines of functions,code, Sql command or even some of the DAX expressions (measures) were used during the analysis training.
Functions like;
- SUMIF
- AVERAGE
- FIND FUNCTION
- LEN FUNCTION
- LEFT and RIGHT FUNCTION
- VLOOKUP
- TEXT FUNCTION etc.

SQL Command like,
- Create Table
- Truncate Table
- SELECT
- Insert
- Update
- Group By
- Order By
- BETWEEN
- JOIN etc

```SQL
SELECT * FROM EMPLOYEE
WHERE FIRSTNAME = 'FEMI'
```

```SQL
UPDATE SALARY
SET SALARY = SALARY * (1 + 0.05)
WHERE STAFFID IN ('AB200', 'AB268','AB278')
```

```SQL
select CustomerID, Customer_Gender, Transaction_Amount
from LITA_Store_Lekki
union
select CustomerID, Customer_Gender, Transaction_amount
from LITA_Store_Marina
```

### Data Visualisation
This is presenting our results using charts, graphs and other visualisation tools.
